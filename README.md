Overview
The Crep Culture website allows users to browse sneakers, read reviews, and contact the store,  all through a clean, responsive layout.
It includes animated testimonials, dynamic shop filtering, and a contact form that submits data without reloading the page.I really focused on improving the layout, animations, and responsiveness across all pages.

Here are my current changes and updates for my website. 

1.The Floating Testimonials:
Added floating testimonial bubbles that gently move across the About page.
Each testimonial includes a profile picture and star rating for a more personal and realistic touch.
They’re swipeable on mobile devices too!

2.The Layout and Design Improvements:
I improved alignment and spacing in the blog and shop sections.
I also used aspect-ratio, object-fit, and flexbox to make images look clean and balanced.
I added hover effects and smooth transitions across interactive elements for a more polished and cool look.

3.These Are The Functionality Updates:
Search & Sort buttons are now functioning. Users can now search and sort sneakers dynamically using JavaScript.
AJAX Contact Form made the exisitng form interactive and responsive. The contact form now submits messages asynchronously (without refreshing).
Success Message Styling was added . I replaced pop-up alerts with styled success and error messages to make feedback look more natural and user friendly.

4.The Responsiveness Fixes I Made To The Website:
I made sure the entire site works well and responses across all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
I also fix carousel visibility issues on smaller screens as it wasn't working before.
Adjusted testimonial layout to show sideb by side on large screens and stack neatly on smaller ones.

5.The Tools and Technologies i used :
HTML5
CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Transitions)
JavaScript
AJAX for the form

Font Awesome (for icons)
